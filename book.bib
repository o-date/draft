@inproceedings{Hensinger_et_al_2013,
	Abstract = {We use Machine Learning techniques to model the reading preferences of audiences of 14 online news outlets. The models, describing the appeal of a given article to each audience, are formed by linear functions of word frequencies, and are obtained by comparing articles that became ``Most Popular'' on a given day in a given outlet with articles that did not. We make use of 2,432,148 such article pairs, collected over a period of over 1.5 years. Those models are shown to be predictive of user choices, and they are then used to compare both the audiences and the contents of various news outlets. In the first case, we find that there is a significant correlation between demographic profiles of audiences and their preferences. In the second case we find that content appeal is related both to writing style - with more sentimentally charged language being preferred, and to content with ``Public Affairs'' topics, such as ``Finance'' and ``Politics'', being less preferred.},

Computer-based text analysis has been employed for the past several decades as a way of searching, collating, and indexing texts. Despite this, the digital revolution has not penetrated the core activity of literary studies: interpretive analysis of written texts. Computers can handle vast amounts of data, allowing for the comparison of texts in ways that were previously too overwhelming for individuals, but they may also assist in enhancing the entirely necessary role of subjectivity in critical interpretation. Reading Machines discusses the importance of this new form of text analysis conducted with the assistance of computers. Ramsay suggests that the rigidity of computation can be enlisted in the project of intuition, subjectivity, and play.},

@article{ingold_science_2016,
	Abstract = {In this paper I look back over four decades of my career as a professional anthropologist, starting with an orientation that was heavily weighted towards the natural sciences, and ending in a project that seeks to integrate anthropology with the practices of art, architecture and design. This was also a period during which science increasingly lost its ecological bearings, while the arts increasingly gained them. Tracing the journey in my own teaching and research, I show how the literary reference points changed, from foundational texts in human and animal ecology, now largely forgotten, through attempts to marry the social and the ecological inspired by the Marxian revival, to contemporary writing on post-humanism and the conditions of the Anthropocene. For me this has been an Odyssey -- a journey home -- to the kind of science imbibed in childhood, as the son of a prominent mycologist. This was a science grounded in tacit wonder at the exquisite beauty of the natural world, and in silent gratitude for what we owe to this world for our existence. Today's science, however, has turned wonder and gratitude into commodities. They no longer guide its practices, but are rather invoked to advertise its results. The goals of science are modelling, prediction and control. Is that why, more and more, we turn to art to rediscover the humility that science has lost?},

	Abstract = {In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:
            Deformance and Interpretation  Lisa Samuels (bio) and  Jerome McGann (bio)    With nothing can one approach a work of art so little as with critical words: they always come down to more or less happy misunderstandings. Rainer Maria Rilke, Letters to a Young Poet 1   I have often noticed that we are inclined to endow our friends with the stability of type that literary characters acquire in the reader's mind. No matter how many times we reopen ``King Lear,'' never shall we find the good king banging his tankard in high revelry, all woes forgotten, at a jolly reunion with all three daughters and their lapdogs. Never will Emma rally, revived by the sympathetic salts in Flaubert's father's timely tear. Whatever revolution this or that popular character has gone through between the book covers, his fate is fixed in our minds, and, similarly, we expect our friends to follow this or that logical and conventional pattern we have fixed for them. Thus X will never compose the immortal music that would clash with the second-rate symphonies he has accustomed us to. Y will never commit murder. Under no circumstances can Z ever betray us. We have it all arranged in our minds, and the less often we see a particular person the more satisfying it is to check how obediently he conforms to our notion of him every time we hear of him. Any deviation in the fates we have ordained would strike us as not only anomalous but unethical. Vladimir Nabokov, Lolita 2   I. A Question of Interpretation Works of imagination encourage interpreters, who respond in diverse and inventive ways. The variety of critical practices---indeed, the number of differing interpretations directed at the same works---can obscure the theoretical commonality that holds those practices together. We can draw an immediate distinction, however, [End Page 25] between critical practices which do or do not aim to be interpretive: bibliographical studies and prosodic analysis, for example, typically discount their interpretive moves, if any are explicitly engaged. The usual object of interpretation is ``meaning,'' or some set of ideas that can be cast in thematic form. These meanings are sought in different ways: as though resident ``in'' the work, or evoked through ``reader-response,'' or deconstructable through a process that would reinstall a structure of intelligibility at a higher, more critical level. The contemporary terminology will not obscure the long-standing character of such practices, which can be mixed in various ways. In all these cases, however, an essential relation is preserved between an artistic work and some structure of ideas, that is, some conceptual form that gets more or less fully articulated ``for'' the work. To understand a work of art, interpreters try to close with a structure of thought that represents its essential idea(s). In this paper we want to propose---or recall---another way of engaging imaginative work. Perhaps as ancient as more normative practices, it has been less in vogue for some time. This alternative does not stand opposed to interpretive procedures as such, nor to the elaboration of conceptual equivalents for imaginative work. But it does try to set these modes of exegesis on a new footing. The alternative moves to break beyond conceptual analysis into the kinds of knowledge involved in performative operations---a practice of everyday imaginative life. We will argue that concept-based interpretation, reading along thematic lines, is itself best understood as a particular type of performative and rhetorical operation.   II. Reading Backward In an undated fragment on a leaf of stationery, Emily Dickinson wrote what appears to be one of her ``letters to the world'': ``Did you ever read one of her Poems backward, because the plunge from the front overturned you? I sometimes (often have, many times) have---a Something overtakes the Mind'' (Prose Fragment 30). 3 In the light of recent promotions of ``antithetical'' reading models, we might find Dickinson's idea a compatible one. But the physical and performative character of her proposal sets it in a tradition of reading and criticism far different from those we have cultivated in the twentieth century. This difference is exactly why we should listen to what she...},

Using the example of our work with a particularly large and complex dataset collated for the purpose of the English Landscape and Identities project (EngLaID), Oxford, UK, and drawing on insights from social scientists' studies of information infrastructures much more broadly, we make the following key points. Firstly, alongside scrutinising and homogenising digital records for research purposes, it is vital that we continue to appreciate the broader interpretative value of `characterful' archaeological data (those that have histories and flaws of various kinds). Secondly, given the intricate and pliable nature of archaeological data and the substantial challenges faced by researchers seeking to create a cyber-infrastructure for archaeology, it is essential that we develop interim measures that allow us to explore the parameters and potentials of working with archaeological evidence on an unprecedented scale. We also consider some of the practical and ethical consequences of working in this vein.},

However, the expensive nature of archaeological work often leads to a struggle for funding. Crowdfunding allows us to leverage archaeology's popular appeal to find the funds we have long struggled (and often failed) to obtain through traditional means. Furthermore, it lets us interact with the public in a new and novel way, allowing the different voices and narratives of the public to be heard. This thesis explores some of the benefits of crowdfunding. As well, data on crowdfunded archaeology projects were collected and analyzed and certain key success metrics were identified. Using these, a basic framework was developed to aid potential archaeological crowd funders. Considerations such as platform, media elements, and language, are an important part of the process. When used strategically, this tool can help unearth much for both the archaeologist and the public.},

	Abstract = {This article represents a systematic effort to answer the question, What are archaeology's most important scientific challenges? Starting with a crowd-sourced query directed broadly to the professional community of archaeologists, the authors augmented, prioritized, and refined the responses during a two-day workshop focused specifically on this question. The resulting 25 "grand challenges" focus on dynamic cultural processes and the operation of coupled human and natural systems. We organize these challenges into five topics: (1) emergence, communities, and complexity; (2) resilience, persistence, transformation, and collapse; (3) movement, mobility, and migration; (4) cognition, behavior, and identity; and (5) human-environment interactions. A discussion and a brief list of references accompany each question. An important goal in identifying these challenges is to inform decisions on infrastructure investments for archaeology. Our premise is that the highest priority investments should enable us to address the most important questions. Addressing many of these challenges will require both sophisticated modeling and large-scale synthetic research that are only now becoming possible. Although new archaeological fieldwork will be essential, the greatest payoff will derive from investments that provide sophisticated research access to the explosion in systematically collected archaeological data that has occurred over the last several decades. Este art{\'\i}culo representa un esfuerzo sistem{\'a}tico para responder a la pregunta: ¿Cu{\'a}les son los retos cient{\'\i}ficos m{\'a}s importantes de la arqueolog{\'\i}a?

Current technologies can help ameliorate this, but scholars generally lack the time and technological know-how to disseminate data. We put forth a model of ``data sharing as publishing'' as a means to address the concerns around data dissemination.},

@book{kansa_archaeology_2011,
	Abstract = {How is the Web transforming the professional practice of archaeology? And as archaeologists accustomed to dealing with ``deep time,'' how can we best understand the possibilities and limitations of the Web in meeting the specialized needs of professionals in this field? These are among the many questions posed and addressed in Archaeology 2.0: New Approaches to Communication and Collaboration, edited by Eric Kansa, Sarah Whitcher Kansa, and Ethan Watrall. With contributions from a range of experts in archaeology and technology, this volume is organized around four key topics that illuminate how the revolution in communications technology reverberates across the discipline: approaches to information retrieval and information access; practical and theoretical concerns inherent in design choices for archaeology's computing infrastructure; collaboration through the development of new technologies that connect field-based researchers and specialists within an international archaeological community; and scholarly communications issues, with an emphasis on concerns over sustainability and preservation imperatives. This book not only describes practices that attempt to mitigate some of the problems associated with the Web, such as information overload and disinformation, it also presents compelling case studies of actual digital projects---many of which are rich in structured data and multimedia content or focused on generating content from the field ``in real time,'' and all of which demonstrate how the Web can and is being used to transform archaeological communications into forms that are more open, inclusive, and participatory. Above all, this volume aims to share these experiences to provide useful guidance for other researchers interested in applying technology to archaeology.},

Although it is widely accepted that the term Web 2.0 was coined by Tim O'Reilly in 2003, a comprehensive literature review shows that the term had been used previously. Specifically, in 1999, the designer Darcy DiNucci talked about Web 2.0 in an article published in Print Magazine. In addition, this paper analyzes the meaning of the concept Web 2.0 and its influence on public relations. Knowing the origin of Web 2.0 will enable us to understand the new communication paradigm },
